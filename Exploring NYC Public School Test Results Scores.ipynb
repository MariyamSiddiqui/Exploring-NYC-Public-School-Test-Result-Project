The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and high-performing schools based on their SAT scores. Key tasks performed in this project include:\n\n‚úÖ Identifying top math performers: Schools where the average math score is at least 80% of the maximum possible score (i.e., 640 out of 800).\n\nüèÜ Finding top 10 overall schools: Based on the combined SAT score, which includes math, reading, and writing.\n\nüìç Analyzing borough-level variation: Determining which single borough shows the highest standard deviation in combined SAT scores, indicating the widest variation in performance among its schools.\n\nThis analysis provides insights into academic performance across different schools and boroughs, highlighting excellence and disparities in SAT outcomes.",
